# CLAUDE.md — STR Law Guys Sales & Marketing Dashboard

## Project Overview
A live sales and marketing KPI dashboard for STR Law Guys, pulling data from their Google Sheets tracking spreadsheet and GHL CRM to display leads, call metrics, deals closed, and ad spend performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Backend / API**: Supabase Edge Functions
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres (caching layer for Sheets data)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Key Commands
- **Dev server**: `npm run dev`
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Test**: `npm run test`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint`

## File Structure
```
src/
├── components/   – Reusable UI components (KPI cards, charts, tables)
├── pages/        – Route-level page components (Overview, Funnel, By Source, etc.)
├── lib/          – Google Sheets client, GHL API client, utility functions
├── hooks/        – Custom React hooks
└── types/        – TypeScript type definitions
```

## Architecture Notes
Data is sourced from the STR Law Guys Google Sheets Appointments tab and GHL CRM. The Google Sheets client uses a service account for read access. Supabase is used as a caching layer to avoid hitting the Sheets API on every request. Dashboard pages map 1:1 to the sidebar nav: Overview, Funnel, By Source, Weekly Calls, Sales Calls & Training, Closed Deals, Weekly Progress, Email Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Report Notes.

## Key Data Sources
- **Google Sheets**: Spreadsheet ID `1fbtPJNT7jcD1LBrIVsIdJePeRNwsDMAjS-ZDGqKuFOE` — Appointments tab (sheet ID `146168904`)
- **GHL CRM**: Location ID `juDyJd0r4rG1HB2SULYJ`, Main Pipeline ID `QrhT9D8C4WdbL8qNW2FT`
- **Service Account**: `str-dashboard@claude-api-498411.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

## Environment Variables
- All secrets in `.env` (never committed — listed in `.gitignore`)
- See `.env.example` for required variable names and placeholder values

## Security
- See `SECURITY.md` for all security rules — they are non-negotiable
- RLS enabled on all database tables; every query scoped by org/user

## Git Workflow — ALWAYS follow this order
1. Commit changes and push to `dev` branch — NEVER commit directly to `master`
2. After pushing, tell Ed: **"Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000` to verify"**
3. If Ed says it looks good, immediately merge `dev` → `master` and push — no extra confirmation needed
4. `master` is connected to Vercel production — every push triggers a deploy
5. Always tell Ed what to look at when verifying (which page, which section, what changed)

## Definition of Done
1. Behavior matches the request
2. No console or terminal errors
3. /review passes
4. Tests pass (if any exist) / test data verified
5. Changes pushed to `dev` and verified; merged to `master` only on Ed's go-ahead

## Current Status
